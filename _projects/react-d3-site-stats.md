This was a "quick" project thrown together from my desire to learn how to use D3.js within the React-Redux ecosystem. I released a publicly viewable version of the stats at the link below. The page pulls the data from the Rails backend API that uses the Ahoy gem.

The code was heavily inspired by https://github.com/tibotiber/rd3.

This and all of the other code that runs thelocus.co can be found at https://github.com/loualrid/locuscorev3.
