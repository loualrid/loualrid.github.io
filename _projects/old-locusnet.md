I had been toying with a template somewhat similar to this design since the summer of 2011 but never had the time to actually get it release ready. I decided on first of June of 2012 that I would sit down and get everything ship shape and ready to deploy. What spurred this change? Getting a job at Trinovus e-banking and realizing the real world is about to begin… Regardless, the end result looks rather nice. The site is designed to handle these goals:

* Be my personal home page and link me directly to everything I am interested in on the web (I love lightboxes)
* Give me a way to express my artistic side to the fullest
* Be the gateway between what I’ve done and the world (I deleted my Facebook out of spite for what that company has become)
* Be the primary tool I use to document my life after college
* Be the primary way people can discover or contact me

However, there’s a bit more to it than that. Under the wordpress framework, I setup that wordpress install to be capable of multi-site. One of my goals was to use this infrastructure to gather friends and like-minded individuals to this hosting package and utilize it as a set of professional blogs. The hosting package I used is from Dreamhost. They provide very high quality hosting packages for those who value convenience over spending days tweaking settings to get everything *just* right (instead its just an hour or two of tweaking). With enough traffic / individuals interested in joining the Locusnet, I will be upgrading the package as needed (private VPS anyone?). Those interested in joining this package should drop me a line at loualrid@gmail.com or simply just add a comment to this portfolio item.

For those who are interested, I may or may not be willing to build sites for you. It mostly depends on the site concept and what you’re asking for. For others simply looking for a web designer / developer for contract work, the above also applies (I do work full-time). Regardless, get in contact with me in some way if you want to.
