This was an interesting project completed between Mid December 2011 and Mid January 2012.

* Called in for developer assistance by Marc Aarons
* Design was already complete in photoshop design docs, features just needed to be implemented in wordpress
* PHP/Javascript features
** Jquery touch-ups / effects
** Contact Form - Contact Form 7 Wordpress plugin
** Sliders - Vslider wordpress plugin
** Setup - PHP scripting

It was a little rough around the edges. Knowing what I know now, I probably would of written it in rails, but its not bad for a PHP wordpress site.
