Cheftacular is the culmination of 8 months of DevOps experience I accumulated at SocialCentiv. First off, I built it's initial version to save me significant amount of time compared to Chef's [Knife](https://docs.chef.io/knife.html) tool as while Knife is very effective at what it does, it's more for DevOps than actual server administration. It also leaves people who are not invested in DevOps out to dry without plugins (that must be configured and integrated). The main goal of Cheftacular was to address the lack of a solid DevOps tool for managing the server administration and interaction side of the Chef equation. Essentially to give you a simple CLI (akin to Heroku's toolbelt) for interacting with your infrastructure.

More information about the gem itself can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SocialCentivPublic/cheftacular).
