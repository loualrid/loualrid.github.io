I had always wanted a *better* way of utilizing scenejs within rails.

 The standard way of dealing with javascript plugins / libraries was incompatible with the library. After doing some mild tinkering with the concept a couple months ago, I initially shelved the idea of turning it into a gem and instead opted for modifying the source slightly to get it to read data from a path within the app as a quick fix. It was only recently (October 23rd, 2013 in fact) that I decided to sit down and compile it all into a gem for true DRYness and use within the FOSS community. The gem was simple to create, it was simply a matter of establishing scope and aiming for DRY. Needless to say, the gem is extremely handy for this web application and rails apps that plan to use complex scenejs scenes.

More information about the gem itself can be found on [Github](https://github.com/loualrid/scenejs_on_rails).
