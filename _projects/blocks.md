My work on blocks mostly revolved around the Rspec test suite. One of my main goals was to keep test coverage high and assist in debugging CI issues.

I also worked on UI modules that were user facing, these were pretty much your standard jQuery + HAML fare as far as Rails apps go.

The most difficult part of this project was implementing some recursive SQL statements and writing tests for them. Politech has some very interesting SQL needs.
