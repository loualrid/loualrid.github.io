This site is no longer online for various reasons. A memory of it is preserved here.

* Built from scratch as a "Lets see if I can actually do this" project
* Built to promote the Association of Computing Machinery and Texas Tech University
* PHP Code was passed in full to the future webmasters of ACM. I only offered to play a support role for bugs.
* Integration with social media feeds (twitter and facebook)
* Feature rich, had spaces where officers could edit pages as well as a forum and organization calendar.
