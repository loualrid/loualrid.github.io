The Cheftacular Cookbook deserves special mention, where Cheftacular is the tool, the cookbook is what actually brings that tool to usefulness.

While development is ongoing, the cookbook serves as a repository of what is possible with cheftacular and what it is capable of doing when all of it's configurations are set. This cookbook utilizes over 80 open-source cookbooks to create and configure environments focused around ruby on rails backends and a myriad of frontends.

More information about the cookbook itself can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SocialCentivPublic/TheCheftacularCookbook).
