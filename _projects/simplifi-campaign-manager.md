At Simpli.fi, all of the Full Stack engineers are heavily tied to the primary web app and thus campaign management. Any new client-facing feature touched campaign management in some way and ensuring that a new addition did not break anything else was a constant focus of unit and integration tests. Engineers tended to specialize and become domain experts in whatever parts of the app they worked on along with the supporting infrastructure / systems that touched that part.

My focus was primarily on the geofencing, private marketplace deals and general integration tests during my tenure from mid 2018 to late 2023. It is a very customer-centric role as it lied at the intersection between UX, product and data, full stack engineers needed to bring the UX designs to life while intelligently incorporating the deep reporting data available (or soon to be available in the case of greenfield development) and then iterating on the feature with beta clients / users to ensure the feature meets the user expectations.
